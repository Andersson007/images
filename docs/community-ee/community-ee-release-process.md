  ```

## Actual Build Steps :

### On the terminal

      - Check the ansible-core version [here](https://pypi.org/project/ansible-core/)
      - Verify ansible collection versions for ansible.posix, ansible.utils and  ansible.windows for `deps` file of the ansible version for the related release  [ansible-build-data repo](https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data).
      - Go to the images/execution-environments directory.
      - Create the correct `git branch` (name it in the related version eg: 2.17.1-1)

        ```
            cd images/execution-environments
            git checkout main
            git pull upstream main
            git checkout -b coreversion-eeversion

        ```

      - Update the ansible-core and collection versions in the  `/images/execution-environments/community-ee-base/execution-environment.yml` file.
      - Update the ansible-core version in the  `/images/execution-environments/community-ee-minimal/execution-environment.yml` file, commit the changes and create a PR.

        ```
            vim community-ee-base/execution-environment.yml`
            git add -u
            git status
            git commit -m "Updates ansible-core & collection versions for Base and Minimal"
            git push origin branch_name
        ```
      - Once the PR is merged, it is the time to start with the github action workflow.
